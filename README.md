# Go API with Gin Framework README
Welcome to the Go API project built using the Gin framework! This repository contains an example of creating a RESTful API using Go programming language and the Gin framework. Gin is a lightweight web framework for Go that provides a fast and minimalistic API for building web applications.

## Features
1. **RESTful Endpoints:** Implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via RESTful endpoints using Gin's router and middleware functionalities.

2. **JSON Payloads:** Communicates data between clients and the server using JSON payloads, providing a standardized format for data exchange.

3. **Middleware Support:** Utilizes Gin's middleware support for handling cross-cutting concerns such as logging, error handling, and request/response processing.

4. **Request Parsing and Validation:** Parses incoming requests and validates request payloads using Gin's request binding and validation features, ensuring data integrity and security.

5. **Database Integration:** Integrates with a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) for persistent storage of application data using database libraries compatible with Gin (e.g., Gorm, SQLx).

6. **Authentication and Authorization:** Provides mechanisms for user authentication and authorization, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication or session-based authentication, to secure access to protected resources.

7. **Testing:** Includes unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of API endpoints and functionalities, leveraging testing libraries compatible with Gin (e.g., httptest, testify).

## Installation
To set up the Go API with Gin Framework:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Radina/Go-API.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd Go-API

3. **Install Dependencies:*8 Install any dependencies required for the project using Go modules or package management tools like dep or go mod.

4. **Configure Environment Variables:** Set up environment variables required for the application, such as database connection details, API keys, and secret keys.

5. **Run the Application:** Start the Go API server using the appropriate commands for your environment (e.g., go run main.go).

## Usage
1. **Send HTTP Requests:** Use tools like cURL, Postman, or any HTTP client to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

2. **Authentication:**  Authenticate users if required by sending tokens or credentials in the request headers for accessing protected resources.

3. **Handle Responses:** Process responses received from the API server, handling success responses (2xx status codes) and error responses (4xx, 5xx status codes) appropriately.

4. **Testing:** Write and run tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of API endpoints and functionalities, covering both positive and negative scenarios.

## Customization
1. **Endpoint Configuration:** Customize API endpoints, route paths, and request/response formats according to the requirements of your application.

2. **Middleware Functions:** Implement additional middleware functions for handling specific application logic, such as rate limiting, caching, or authentication checks.

3. **Database Integration:** Integrate with different types of databases (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL databases) based on the scalability, performance, and data modeling requirements of your application using Gin-compatible database libraries.
